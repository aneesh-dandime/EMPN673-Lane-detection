## Instructions to run

## Problem 1 - Histogram equalisation
## Outputs will be stored in ./data/outputs/ folder as
## ./data/outputs/hist_eq_images -> histogram equalized images
## ./data/outputs/adap_hist_eq_images -> adaptive histogram equalized images
`python solution1.py -ip <path_to_images>`

## Problem 2 - Lane detection
## Output video will be stored in ./data/outputs as "whiteline_processed.mp4"
`python solution2.py -vp <path_to_video>`

## Problem 3 - Lane curvature detection
## Output video will be stored in ./data/outputs as "challenge_processed.mp4"
`python solution3.py -vp <path_to_video>`
